                        <p>
                            Welcome to my complete journey. People have this notion that my life is all about 
                            rainbows and sunshine, as I am always on the road, out there exploring the world and "living the life."
                            What the public doesn't see is the arduous climb filled with setbacks and difficulties that came before.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The Journey Starts from Philippines.
                            I was born in Ireland and raised in the Philippines, where life was synchronised to the beat of tropical
                            rain and warm sun. Growing up in Lesseb, Burgos, Ilocos, Sur, my childhood was immersed in the fragrance 
                            of sampaguita flowers, the flavour of ripe mangoes plucked fresh from our neighbor's tree, and weekend 
                            visits to nearby beaches where water shone like scattered diamonds.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I grew up in a middle-class family, and though we had little in the way of material wealth, we were
                            richly endowed with stories. My lola would weave beautiful baskets as she told stories of our ancestors, 
                            filling me with wonder at the world beyond our shores. Every evening news broadcast with far-off countries
                            sowed seeds of curiosity that would later germinate to an insatiable wanderlust.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was 15 when I went to Dublin for study. It was a life-changing experience, as I had to adapt to a new 
                            culture and environment. My first solo journey was to Geneva, Switzerland, in the last week of October when
                            I was 18 years old. Homesickness at first was overwhelming; I never thought I would be able to savor the wild 
                            jeepney ride, the blur of neighbor's "Kamusta ka?" and my mamang Linda's Adobo-- no restaurant ever could 
                            duplicate its special taste. But the distance made me look, it helped me appreciate the rich cultural prism 
                            through which I see the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that I travel from continent to continent, I bring the Philippines with me-- in my effortless smile even to 
                            strangers, in my resilience tempered by typhoon years, and in my capacity to see the beauty in the little things.
                            My roots do not encumber me; they anchor me, enough to give me wings to fly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By my journey, I wish to share not just the adventures, but the lessons learned and thoughts as well that unfold 
                            step by step. Come with me on this journey of discovery and exploration as I go on and continue to rediscover the 
                            world's beauty and ultimately, myself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This journey began many years ago when I decided to take that first step into the unknown. 
                            Every adventure has its challenges, but those challenges are what shape us into who we are meant to be.
                        </p>
